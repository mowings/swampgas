All arrangements are performed by me without permission -- but trust
me, I'm no threat to the original artist's income stream ... Most songs are
recorded on either on my Lowden D-32, or a Papoose travel guitar, which
is a pretty cool little instrument in its own right.

### Lament for Limerick/It's Not Yet Day
This short arrangement of <i>Lament
For Limerick</i> is based loosely on Duck Baker's version from the CD <b>Irish
Jigs, Reels, Airs and Hornpipes</b> (SHANACHIE 97011). The Arrangement
of <i>It's Not Yet Day</i> is completely my own. My debut arrangement
-- be gentle with me.
      <p> Played on the Papoose Travel Guitar in DGDGCD (low to high)
(Gsus4). <a href="/media/audio/nyday.mp3">[Play]</a> </p>

### Last Farewell to Stirling
A very simple arrangement of a
very simple tune. Supposedly a Scottish transportation ballad which
comes by way of Australia. I heard this on the <b>Battlefield Band</b>
CD reissue of <i>Stand Easy</i> and <i>Preview</i> (Temple Records
COMD2052). This arrangement could still use a lot of work, especially
at the break in the middle.

### My Generous Lover/Donal Ogg
Papoosified version
of <b>My Generous Lover/Donal Og</b> From Martin Simpson's <b>Acoustic
Guitar Instrumentals Video #3</b>. I highly recommend this entire video
series (3 tapes in all) available through <a
 href="http://www.homespuntapes.com"> Homespun Tapes</a>. Simpson is
really an incredible musician and teacher.

Played on the Papoose Travel Guitar in DGDGCD (low to high).
Actually, the Papoose is tuned 5 steps up from a regular guitar -- so
on a standard guitar, tune to DGDGCD (Gsus4) and Capo V to get this
same effect.<a href="/media/audio/genlov.mp3"> [Play]</a>

### Rosie Anderson
The <b>Rosie Anderson</b> part
from the medely _Rosie
Anderson/This Shearing's Not For You/Bogie's Bonnie Belle_ (see
below), recorded with the ATM-35. Sounds a lot nicer than just using
the Fishman Pickup. <br>

DADGBE (Dropped-D) tuning, capoed at the fifth fret. <a

### Rosie Anderson (Papoose Version)
The <b>Rosie Anderson</b> part
from the medely _Rosie
Anderson/This Shearing's Not For You/Bogie's Bonnie Belle_ recorded
with the <b>Papoose</b> Travel Guitar.

Recorded on the <b>Papoose</b> in DADGBE (Dropped-D)
tuning.&nbsp; <a href="/media/audio/rosie2.mp3">[Play]</a>

### March of the King of Laoise
An approximation of Duck
Baker's version of this stately tune from <b>Mel Bay's Complete Celtic
Fingerstyle Guitar Book</b> (by Stefan Grossman, Duck Baker and El
McMeen) available from <a href="http://www.melbay.com"> Mel Bay
Publications</a>. I find the rhythmic playing on this one somewhat
difficult, so I have cheated a bit in my playing. I also added
substantial echo effects to the track which fill things out a bit and
help mask the occasional playing error.

Dropped-D tuning: DADGBE, capoed at the third fret, which
makes some of the awkward finger stretches in this tune less so. This
is my first attempt at recording with an actual mike (Audio Technica
ATM-35), rather than simply going with the output from my Fishman
Acoustic Matrix, and the results are MUCH better than before. <a
