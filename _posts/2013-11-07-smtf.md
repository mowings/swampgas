Trad. Shepherd Mouthblown
Smallpipes in D. I bought these a couple of years ago on a
whim. Why try to emulate bagpipes on a guitar when I could just
buy a set and play the real thing? Unfortunately, my first attempt
playing sounded a lot like a flock of penguins choking to death (as it
turns out, pipes aren't generally shipped 
_in tune_. I put the pipes aside
immediately, and for the next two years they lay unused in my office,
always turning up underfoot, awkwardly splayed on top of
Very Important Papers, or just generally being in the way. 

I finally resolved that either I would learn how
to tune the pipes, or it was off to eBay with them. After a
little research, I managed and even learned a couple of tunes (sort
of). Here's one:

### Dropped
The same tune dropped to A:
