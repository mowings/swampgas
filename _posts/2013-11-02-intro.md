UFO enthusiasts -- or UFOlogists, as some like to call
themselves -- frequently subscribe to myriad theories involving vast
Government cover-ups to bury credible evidence of alien visitation.
Upon even the most cursory of examinations the implausibilty of these
theories becomes immediately apparent.

But the **careful** researcher will note the traces of otherness in such fantasies, the telltale signs of
deliberate construction and intelligent manipulation by another species
more evolved -- or perhaps just shrewder -- than our own. But on still
closer inspection, this same researcher might reconsider,
as the "telltale signs of manipulation" themselves show signs of
terrestrial fabrication, misleading cues calculated to throw us off the
scent, as it were. Clearly, we are dealing here with a cleverly crafted
myth -- but to what purpose? What of the myth''s
origins? It seems at first to unmistakably derive from a 1949 Arbor
Day meeting of top industrialists and government officials in tiny
Milpitas, CA. But then other evidence points back to what appears to be
a hastily organized clandestine gathering of scientists,
Russian "Whites", various clergy and other parties unknown shortly
after the Tunguska event of 1908. This may in turn be contradicted
by much earlier writings dating back to pre-Renaissance Italy, and yet
again by other artifacts believed to be contemporaneous with the
emergence of human language itself.

The contradictions are dizzying, and it will soon become
apparent to the **intuitive** researcher that our
mythical narrative cannot be studied in terms of its particulars, for
those particulars are ever-changing -- this is to be expected and is
inherent in the design of the narrative. So the intuitive researcher
will give up, move on to greener pastures and thus avoid forever
wandering a long, empty hall of mirrors whose
beginning and end are unknown and forever unknowable.

So that is my advice to you: give up. Move on to greener
pastures. Because the **foolish** researcher will see
that this thing can only be understood in its entirety from outside the
safe confines of human culture. He will cast off the chains of
immanence once he discovers how, and cut himself adrift in a vast, dark
and ancient ocean of loneliness. And in doing so, surely die.
