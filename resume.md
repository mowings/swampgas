#### 2009 - 2012 | iSeatz, Inc. | Senior Engineer, Director of Operations
iSeatz provides turn-key, high-availability multi-lingual travel websites and 
services for major airlines, banks and other partners. Duties at iSeatz
spanned a wide variety of areas, including systems architecture and administration, booking 
webservices architecture and coding, and front-end development. iSeatz is an Agile 
shop, with most coding done in Ruby/Rails, with deployment over clusters of 
Amazon EC2 instances running CentOS Linux. The database in use is a cluster 
of postgres9 servers running over EBS volumes in a raid 1+0 configuration. 

Highlights from iSeatz include:

* Oversaw expanding IT staff as manager and Director. Responsibilities
in addition to day-to-day management included Disaster Recovery
Planning, PCI compliance (external audit), interfacing with clients and
partners, etc.
* Hotel booking web services architecture and coding. Responsible 
for this complex, multi-supplier real-time hotel availability and booking 
engine. Ruby, Rails.
* Back-end systems scaling, optimization and fail-over. Oversaw EC2
production presence grow from a couple of instances, to a large, dynamic stack of load-balancers, front-end 
servers, large application and database server clusters. Wrote
substantial management code in Ruby.
* Payment processing. Designed and coded the multi-currency payment 
back end. The payment system was built to be relatively resilient to
fraud, and fully PCI-compliant. The payment processor also provided the ability 
for our customer service representatives to do full or partial refunds, and 
supports a detailed audit trail for all credit card transactions. (Ruby,
Rails)
* Systems and database administration. Postgres 8 and 9. 

#### 2005 - 2009 | Turbosquid, Inc. | Senior Engineer
Served in a variety of capacities on a number of key projects utilizing an array of technologies. Duties at TurboSquid ranged from design and coding through technical supervision of overseas teams.  Major projects and roles included:

* The GameFlood website. GameFlood is dedicated to delivering third-party game content (“mods”) to gamers in a simple and unobtrusive way. The site also allows online “mashups”, where users can assemble their own unique content. Duties included design and implementation of the Ajax-based Mashup web-interface, the Search and Game invite systems,  and much more. Other aspects of the system were implemented by an offshore team under my technical supervision. Finally, I designed and developed a content-delivery system, described below, used by the site to download and install game content.
* Design and implementation of  the GameFlood content delivery system, an intelligent mod download and installation engine. This system utilizes a ColdFusion-based back end and an intelligent C++ client to allow automatic download and  installation of third-party game content (“mods”). In addition to supporting features like automatic failover and bandwidth optimization, the system is able to install arbitrary content for arbitrary game titles using dynamically downloaded plugins, which encapsulate game and content-specific installation intelligence. The plugins are written in a simple, but complete scripting language, allowing TurboSquid to leverage less expensive development resources to quickly add support for new titles and content. 
* Embedded storefront design and development. Developed and implemented key technologies used to embed TurboSquid and GameFlood storefronts into third-party programs, including both computer games and 3d-modeling software. We have been able to combine C++ frameworks with Gecko rendering engines and Flash/Flex to yield storefronts with the both the functionality of C++ programs and rich interfaces that are simple and inexpensive to develop. In addition to design and coding, these projects required close technical supervision of offshore teams.
* SEO analysis suite. Duties included developing a suite of tools used to optimize TurboSquid page data for Google page rank. Created tools that use sophisticated  NLP techniques to analyze incoming Google referrals and determine optimum page SEO data. Also developed tools to determine keyword rankings vis-a-vis our competitors to provide ongoing business intelligence, as well as feedback used to optimize our SEO strategy.
General TurboSquid website development. Led numerous projects on main TurboSquid website, including the development of an entirely ajax-based storefront and personal asset manager/publisher, as well as a reimplementation of the site search. These typically involved design and coding, as well as extensive supervision of overseas teams.

#### 2001 - 2005 | Lewis Computer Services | Contractor
Responsible for design and implementation of various aspects of a large SQL distributed database application for use by home healthcare providers. Responsibilities include implementation of numerous system data access objects, business objects (objects that overlay business rules on an underlying SQL database), and infrastructure as well as architecture and implementation of a robust loosely synchronized data replication subsystem. This critical subsystem includes such features as automatic conflict resolution, auditability, error recovery and more.

Other responsibilities include automation of certain aspects of code production, documentation and miscellaneous subsystem design. SQL Server 2000, Win32, C++, and Com/Com+ used extensively.

#### 1998 - 2001 | Netpro Computing, Inc | Principal Engineer
Responsible for technical research and new product architecture. Produced code to serve as core technology of NT Active Directory monitoring products. Wrote and designed extensively using COM, WMI and XML to build a distributed and extended infrastructure for AD monitoring products.

Duties also included research into emerging technologies for possible new product direction for company. These areas included wireless network management and security for 802.11B and Bluetooth Scatternets.
Co-architected and coded the ground-breaking Directory Analyzer Active Directory Monitoring service. Some aspects of this large distributed system architecture have been granted a patent (USP# 6,249,883).
Architected and prototyped a network troubleshooting tool using NASA- developed expert system technology (CLIPS) to assist administrators in troubleshooting and diagnosing network failures.

Pursued and prototyped advanced technologies for gathering network and directory performance data from Microsoft Windows 2000 domain controllers, including TDI monitoring, NDIS intermediate driver data capture, Network Packet Provider (NPP) monitoring and real-time Event
Subsystem capture. Much of this research and the resulting code became central to new products.

#### 1994 - 1998 | Netpro Computing, Inc | Senior Engineer
Key architecture and coding for in-house cross-platform distributed service framework, ERIS. Designed and architected networking-enabled in-situ debugging systems, as well as a robust publisher-subscriber messaging system (the ERIS Publisher).
